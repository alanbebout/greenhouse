# greenhouse
Software to power a miniature semi-autonomous greenhouse.

This code, written for a graduate class, operates a small, semi-autonomous greenhouse which regulates its own light influx and temperature, and signals to a human user when watering is needed. It utilizes the Raspberry Pi Pico W, a powerful, inexpensive microcontroller. Also included is software to train a basic machine learing model to classify the internal environment of the greenhouse into either a "safe" environment for the plants inside, or one of several extreme climate archetypes.
